1,2023-04-12 06:20:45+00:00,LakersReporter,"Anthony Davis (24 points, 15 boards, 4 assists, 3 blocks, 2 steals) was the only starter in the positive, at +9, in LAL‚Äôs 6-point win. 

He acknowledged his mistake fouling Conley, but of course, the Lakers aren‚Äôt even in the game without him. 

Walkoff here:"
2,2023-04-12 05:52:52+00:00,LakersReporter,"The Lakers have been playing important games to battle out of the No. 13 seed for a while. It was very significant to them to get a win tonight to ensure some crucial rest that would have evaporated had they lost tonight, and needed to play on Friday."
3,2023-04-12 05:51:13+00:00,LakersReporter,"Game 1 at Memphis is at 12 p.m. Pacific, on ABC. 

Pregame show on @SpectrumSN at 11 a.m."
4,2023-04-12 05:20:53+00:00,LakersReporter,"The Lakers, who started 2-10 and were 26-32 midway through February in the No. 13 seed, clawed their way up to the No. 7 seed, secured tonight against Minnesota.

They advance to play No. 2 Memphis in Round 1, also eliminating a pick swap with New Orleans."
5,2023-04-12 05:19:16+00:00,LakersReporter,"Darvin Ham said the Lakers chose to prioritize Anthony Edwards defensively, and did effectively limit him to really tough attempts, as he went 3 for 17.

LAL did pay in other ways, giving up open shots elsewhere that Minnesota punished them with, up until the 4th Q and OT."
6,2023-04-12 04:59:35+00:00,LakersReporter,"Schr√∂der, who hasn't sat down since entering the game midway through the 3rd Q (other than the last second of regulation after his corner 3 put LAL up 3) calmly hit 2 FT's to put LAL up 5 with 8.4 seconds left.

Wolves used their last time out to advance the ball."
7,2023-04-12 04:56:20+00:00,LakersReporter,"LAL just barely averted disaster again with a second inbounds turnover in a critical moment. But Prince missed a 3, and it's LAL ball still up 3 with 11.3 left."
8,2023-04-12 04:54:17+00:00,LakersReporter,"LAL have the ball up 3 with 18.8 seconds to play in OT.

Wolves will need to foul after likely attempting to get a steal or turnover. 

Lakers FT's tonight:
LeBron 3 for 3
Davis 3 for 4
Reaves 3 for 3
Schr√∂der 6 for 6
Hachimura 4 for 4"
9,2023-04-12 04:44:49+00:00,LakersReporter,Still 5 PF's on Towns. We'll see if LAL go at him.
10,2023-04-12 04:43:00+00:00,LakersReporter,"Anthony Davis basically shut down the Wolves offense in the 4th Q, holding Minnesota to 9 points with 0.1 seconds left ... but he fouled Mike Conley attempting a game-tying 3, and Conley hit all 3 to force OT. Shades of the Maxi Kleber foul."
11,2023-04-12 04:37:11+00:00,LakersReporter,"Still no points in the final 6 minutes for Minnesota.

LAL's defense has been tremendous, with Davis destroying all kinds of actions."
12,2023-04-12 04:35:15+00:00,LakersReporter,"Minnesota has not scored since the 6:01 mark of the 4th Q, when they led 95-88.

It's now 95-95.

Yet, the Lakers have missed several opportunities to take the lead, and a turnover on the inbounds pass gives MIN the ball with 30.3 seconds left."
13,2023-04-12 04:22:56+00:00,LakersReporter,"Towns has had 5 PF's for the entire quarter, and the Lakers haven't been attacking him."
14,2023-04-12 04:17:12+00:00,LakersReporter,"The Lakers have attempted 43 shots in Minnesota's paint, hitting only 24 against a physical Wolves defense tonight. 

Wolves have attempted 32 shots in the paint, hitting 16.

FT discrepancy is 16 attempts for LAL, and 12 for the Wolves."
15,2023-04-12 04:14:07+00:00,LakersReporter,"Lakers have gotten a huge lift from Dennis Schr√∂der tonight. He has 12 points in his 19 minutes,  with a pair of assists, and is a +10, trailing only Hachimura's +12."
16,2023-04-12 04:10:44+00:00,LakersReporter,"Big swing. Towns got his 5th PF trying to battle Davis on the glass, and Davis scored plus the foul on the ensuing inbounds play.

After a stop, Schr√∂der drew the 5th Minnesota team foul and hit 2 FT's.

LAL within 5 at 89-84, with 8:46 to play."
17,2023-04-12 04:03:36+00:00,LakersReporter,"LAL, down by as many as 15, trimmed the margin to 7 entering the 4th Q.

Davis has played 26 minutes so far, and LeBron 30. 

Towns has 4 PF's for Minnesota, with nobody else in foul trouble."
18,2023-04-12 03:45:51+00:00,LakersReporter,"Wolves are now 12 for 23 from 3 as a team, led by: Conley 4 for 4; Prince 3 for 3; and Towns 2 for 3.

Lakers haven't responded as they needed to out of halftime, and face their biggest deficit of 15 midway through the 3rd Q."
19,2023-04-12 03:17:06+00:00,LakersReporter,"A very, very rough close to the 2nd Q from the Lakers. 

They rallied from an early 11-point deficit to go up 47-46 at the 3:02 mark, but Minnesota responded with a 14-2 run to go up 60-49 at the half, including a 9-0 close."
20,2023-04-12 03:10:51+00:00,LakersReporter,"LAL got in foul trouble early in the 2nd Q with a few unnecessary fouls away from the rim, and have now sent Wolves to the FT line twice in the bonus on reach ins. 

Wolves back up 4 after LAL had rallied to take the lead."
21,2023-04-12 03:05:25+00:00,LakersReporter,"A personal 5-0 run from Austin Reaves has LAL within a single point at 44-43, after a rough start for various reasons had them down by as many as 11.

Davis swatted a Wolves shot at the rim between Reaves buckets, sending LeBron out in transition."
22,2023-04-12 03:01:38+00:00,LakersReporter,"Lots of contact allowed inside tonight, and the Lakers will have to adjust. Only 5 free throw attempts for the NBA leaders thus far, to Minnesota's 8."
23,2023-04-12 03:00:04+00:00,LakersReporter,"Two quick fouls on Karl Anthony-Towns here. Minnesota's suffering from a serious lack of depth in the frontcourt with Gobert's suspension and Naz Reid's injury.

LAL within 6 with 6:14 to play in the 2nd Q."
24,2023-04-12 02:51:54+00:00,LakersReporter,"More of the same, as the Lakers continue not to get out to Minnesota's 3-point shooters - their best threat tonight. Wolves are now 7 for 12 from 3, and shooting 65.2% overall, to LAL's 40.6% (2 of 8 from 3).

Wolves lead 40-31 with 8:17 to play in the 2nd Q."
25,2023-04-12 02:41:25+00:00,LakersReporter,"Two defensive breakdowns from LAL late in the 1st Q left Prince wide open for a pair of 3's, and he hit them both to help Minnesota to a 28-22 lead.

Wolves were hot all period, going 11 for 17, and 5 of 9 from 3. LAL were just 9 for 26, and 2 for 7."
26,2023-04-12 02:26:32+00:00,LakersReporter,"Lakers are getting good shots, but just missing them early. They're 6 for 19 overall, and 0 for 4 from 3, with 0 attempted free throws in a physical game.

Minnesota's hitting most everything, now 7 for 9, and 3 for 4 from 3, to lead 18-12."
27,2023-04-12 02:22:40+00:00,LakersReporter,Great crowd.
28,2023-04-12 00:47:29+00:00,LakersReporter,"Lots of high lottery picks in the starting lineup tonight, with four No. 1 picks (LeBron - 2003; AD - 2012; Karl Anthony-Towns -  2015; Anthony Edwards - 2020), a No. 2 (D‚ÄôAngelo Russell - 2016) and a No. 4 (Mike Conley, 2007)."
29,2023-04-12 00:25:32+00:00,LakersReporter,"Darvin Ham said they have a plan for the rotation in this play-in setting, but will adjust according to how the game goes as far as shortening it. 

Regardless of who‚Äôs in the floor, he said: ‚ÄúWe need to be initiators, not responders‚Äù to ‚Äútake advantage of the opportunity.‚Äù"
30,2023-04-11 21:12:53+00:00,LakersReporter,"Anthony Davis averaged 26.2 points (56.9% FG‚Äôs), an NBA-best 12.5 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.9 blocks. The Lakers were a league-best 14-6 through March and April. Davis scored in double figures in 17 of his 18 games and also dominated defensively."

Dennis Schr√∂der is no longer on the injury report after missing the last two games."

35,2023-04-09 22:11:37+00:00,LakersReporter,"The Lakers secure the No. 7 seed and will play the No. 8 Timberwolves on Tuesday night.

The winner of that game advances to face No. 2 Memphis in Round 1. The loser of that game will host the winner of No. 9 (New Orleans) and No. 10) for the right to play No. 1 Denver."
36,2023-04-09 22:00:18+00:00,LakersReporter,"The Lakers have secured the No. 7 seed, and will host the winner of Minnesota and New Orleans.

Wolves currently lead 109-104 with 47.6 seconds to play. 

The winner of that game, on Tuesday, advances to face Memphis in Round 1."
37,2023-04-09 21:43:03+00:00,LakersReporter,"Clippers and Wolves win: Lakers play Wolves as the No. 7 seed.
Clippers and Pelicans win: Lakers play Pelicans as the No. 7 seed.
Pelicans win and Clippers lose: Lakers play Clippers as the No. 8 seed."
38,2023-04-09 21:41:48+00:00,LakersReporter,"Make it 8 triples for LeBron, after he added another to reach 36 points.

Lakers up 128-117 with 39.7 left.

With the LAC/PHX and MIN/NOP games literally both tied right now, whom LAL play on Tuesday remains up in the air."
39,2023-04-09 21:40:18+00:00,LakersReporter,"LeBron's 7th 3-pointer of the night should be the dagger for LAL, who lead 125-117 with 1 minute to play."
40,2023-04-09 21:17:01+00:00,LakersReporter,"Other than Anthony Davis, it was a very poor defensive quarter for the Lakers, who allowed a 39-point 3rd to the short-handed but hard-charging Jazz.

LAL's 2nd unit has struggled today, and the once 14-point lead has been trimmed to 99-95."
41,2023-04-09 21:04:10+00:00,LakersReporter,"Anthony Davis has been single-handedly destroying Utah's offense in the last several minutes. Blocks, steals, deflections, and so on.

He has 4 blocks and 3 steals in his 26 minutes."
42,2023-04-09 20:31:45+00:00,LakersReporter,"A 12-2 run from LAL's starters, capped by Russell's 2nd 3, has the Lakers back up 11 at 65-54 late in the 2nd Q."
43,2023-04-09 20:28:02+00:00,LakersReporter,"Utah's players, those that haven't been shut down and thus in street clothes, are going extremely hard on both ends, constantly sprinting in transition. LAL won't be able to let their foot off the pedal today."
44,2023-04-09 20:23:47+00:00,LakersReporter,"LAL aren't getting the ball to Anthony Davis enough, especially in the non-LeBron units. 

Davis has 5 FGA's with 4:39 to go in the 2nd Q, amidst a Utah run."
45,2023-04-09 20:06:32+00:00,LakersReporter,"Scratch that: an LAC LOSS and an NOP win would make the Lakers the No. 8 seed, since the Pelicans own that 3-way tiebreaker (LAC would be the 7, LAL the 8)."
46,2023-04-09 20:04:45+00:00,LakersReporter,"All LAL can control  is not having to leave L.A. (with a win).

Only path to the 6 seed includes GSW losing, and they're up 55-27.

LAL are No. 7 w/an LAC win, though LAC trail PHX 28-19.

LAL would be No. 8 with an LAC win and NOP (up 26-16) win."
47,2023-04-09 19:51:44+00:00,LakersReporter,"Strong start from LAL's opening group, especially LeBron (three triples), as they hold a 17-7 lead with the first subs - Beasley and Brown - checking in."
48,2023-04-09 19:45:43+00:00,LakersReporter,"LeBron was especially locked in during his pregame warmup (first pointed out to me by @AaronLarsuel) ... he even threw himself an alley-oops after the Anthem.

His B2B 3's have the Lakers up 10-3 in to the first time out."
49,2023-04-09 18:22:34+00:00,LakersReporter,Dennis Schr√∂der has been downgraded to out for today‚Äôs game due to right Achilles soreness.

53,2023-04-08 05:03:53+00:00,LakersReporter,"The Lakers have secured, at worst, a spot in the 7 vs. 8 play-in game.

They can still technically get to 5th (LAL W, LAC 0-2, GSW L, NOP L), or 6th (LAL W, LAC 1-1, GSW L, NOP L).

There are other permutations with 3- and 4-way ties."
54,2023-04-08 04:37:53+00:00,LakersReporter,"Russell just drilled his 4th, 5th and 6th 3's to put the game away. LAL up 121-105 in the final minute."
55,2023-04-08 04:23:38+00:00,LakersReporter,"LAL's first double-digit lead comes at the 7:34 mark, on a LeBron 3, LAL's 15th, which capped an 11-0 run.  

It's 107-96."
56,2023-04-08 04:20:14+00:00,LakersReporter,"Monty Williams was fined $20K by the NBA for public criticism of officials after LAL beat PHX on March 22, when LAL attempted 46 FT's, including 13 from Reaves. Williams just got a technical foul for complaining, presumably about a foul drawn by Reaves (his first FT's tonight)."
57,2023-04-08 04:13:14+00:00,LakersReporter,"LAL take a 96-89 lead into the 4th Q.

Reaves and Beasley led the way in the 3rd on offense, with AD up to 17 rebounds."
58,2023-04-08 04:07:08+00:00,LakersReporter,"Austin Reaves has been terrific once again, up to 19 points on 9 of 12 FG's with 4 assists in 22 minutes.

His latest bucket put LAL up 4, which is actually their biggest lead tonight, at 89-85 with 1:53 in the 3rd."
59,2023-04-08 03:32:36+00:00,LakersReporter,"The Lakers got a pair of 3's in the final minute, including a corner hit from Russell with 1.9 seconds left, to trim a 7-point deficit to 62-61 at the half.

LAL's 3-point shooting (10 of 18) obscured an inconsistent defensive half, especially on the glass."
60,2023-04-08 03:14:15+00:00,LakersReporter,"Phoenix has an 8-2 edge on the offensive glass, and a 24-18 board advantage overall, helping them to a 46-44 lead despite LAL shooting 50% (seven 3's) to their 42.6% (four 3's)."
61,2023-04-08 02:56:10+00:00,LakersReporter,"D'Angelo Russell has the J falling early, with all 4 jumpers going down, including a pair of pull-up 3's. LAL haven't otherwise been very sharp, but lead 21-19."

68,2023-04-06 04:39:21+00:00,LakersReporter,"Darvin Ham said he wasn't going to able to extend the minutes for AD (32) or LeBron (35) any more than he did, given the circumstances with the B2B and 3 games in 4 nights. Clippers, off since Saturday, were able to extend Kawhi to 43 minutes.

Davis was +9."
69,2023-04-06 04:25:46+00:00,LakersReporter,"LeBron checks out with 33 points (30 in the 2nd half), 8 boards and 7 assists in 35 minutes, after playing 38 minutes last night. It's his first B2B since returning from the foot injury, and he did look very strong physically in the 2nd half."
70,2023-04-06 04:17:49+00:00,LakersReporter,Kawhi Leonard has played 41 minutes with 2 to play.
71,2023-04-06 03:57:12+00:00,LakersReporter,"Two Clipper reserves, Hyland and Mann, hit the 13th and 14th 3's of the game for LAC after LAL held LAC to 1 of 8 3's in the 3rd, and the deficit is quickly back up to 17."
72,2023-04-06 03:52:41+00:00,LakersReporter,"Led by LeBron, who had 16 points in the 3rd period after 3 at halftime, the Lakers trimmed 8 points off the halftime deficit of 19, and trail 93-82 with 12 minutes to play.

We'll see what legs LAL have left on this 3rd game in 4 nights."
73,2023-04-06 03:48:54+00:00,LakersReporter,"Norman Powell's really hurting LAL with AD on the bench, as he did in the 1st half. He's already reached the FT line 8 times, and is scoring on paint pull-ups as well, with 21 off the LAC bench."
74,2023-04-06 03:44:11+00:00,LakersReporter,Lakers have missed 7 FT's tonight (9 for 16). Clippers are 11 for 13.
75,2023-04-06 03:39:19+00:00,LakersReporter,It's a 19-3 Laker run.
76,2023-04-06 03:34:22+00:00,LakersReporter,"With LeBron finding his legs, so have the Lakers, who trim the margin further, to 79-67, after Davis and Reaves scored in the paint. 

Time out LAC."
77,2023-04-06 03:32:44+00:00,LakersReporter,LeBron had all 10 Laker points of the 3rd Q until AD hit 1 of 2 FT's to cut the margin to 14.
78,2023-04-06 03:06:39+00:00,LakersReporter,"After getting within 11 at the 1:29 mark, LAL gave up an 8-0 run, including the 10th and 11th LAC 3's, and enter halftime with their biggest deficit of 19.

LeBron was 1 for 6 for 3 points with 4 TO's in 14 minutes, playing his first B2B since returning from the foot injury."
79,2023-04-06 02:56:57+00:00,LakersReporter,"Lakers just don't have legs. Defensively, where they've been near the top of the league since the trade deadline, they haven't been themselves. LAC now 9 for 14 from 3, and shooting 64.1% overall."
80,2023-04-06 02:37:04+00:00,LakersReporter,"LAL rallied from 12 down to take a short lead, but gave up the 6th and 7th 3's of the quarter to LAC, and find themselves down 37-31. LAC perimeter shooting isn't sustainable, but LAL gave up too many good looks. LAL also missed 4 of 6 FT attempts and turned it over 4 times."
81,2023-04-06 02:32:33+00:00,LakersReporter,"LAL, down 12 early, got B2B 3's from Russell and Brown to take a 26-25 lead late in the 1st Q."

83,2023-04-06 02:22:41+00:00,LakersReporter,"Lakers are happy to let Westbrook shoot, but he happens to be hitting everything to start, 3 for 3 on jumpers with 2 3's.

Westbrook shot 41.7% overall and 29.6% from 3 for LAL in 52 games this year, and 48.4% overall and 32.3% from 3 for the Clippers in 18 games."
84,2023-04-06 02:17:04+00:00,LakersReporter,"Clippers, up 15-3, have been sharper and more aggressive, with a ton more energy. 

Lakers landed at 3 a.m. from Utah last night, and are playing like it.

Clippers are 6 for 9 with 3 3's, and LAL 1 for 7 with several misses around the rim."
85,2023-04-06 02:01:36+00:00,LakersReporter,"While the Clippers haven't played since Saturday in a schedule quirk, the Lakers played both Sunday and Tuesday. 

LeBron has played 67 total minutes, and AD 72.

They'll both start alongside Russell, Reaves and Vanderbilt."
86,2023-04-06 01:18:37+00:00,LakersReporter,"Everybody is available for the Lakers, including LeBron, AD, Russell and Bamba."
87,2023-04-06 00:46:54+00:00,LakersReporter,"LeBron and AD are both true game-time decisions to play, said Darvin Ham.

1417,2022-10-19 05:14:49+00:00,LakersReporter,"Final: GSW 123, LAL 109.

LeBron ended up with 31, 14 and 8, and AD 27, 6 and 4 steals, but both were well into the - in plus/minus as the defending champs were too much from a team standpoint."
1418,2022-10-19 05:11:37+00:00,LakersReporter,"The biggest difference tonight was a dominant 3rd Q from GSW, where they outscored LAL 32-19, scoring inside and out and forcing turnovers on the other end. 

LAL lack of cohesion showed up against GSW's ball movement, and jumpers didn't fall from outside (9 for 39)."

Davis led the way with 15 points, while LeBron reached 14 with his 9 boards despite 5 for 15 FG's, and 0 for 5 from 3.

LAL hit just 3 of 21 3's in the half, to GSW's 5 for 20."

Warriors are shooting. just 7 for 24, mostly on jumpers, and they've made 3 of 10 3's. 

Lakers have hit only 1 of 9 3's, but they're doing consistent damage inside.

GSW leads 23-22 with 47.0 left in the 1st Q."
1421,2022-10-19 03:04:11+00:00,LakersReporter,"Terrific stretch from @AntDavis23, doing all kinds of things on both ends. Steals, blocks, and-1's, hooks.

9-0 run has the game tied at 22."
1422,2022-10-19 02:51:39+00:00,LakersReporter,"The Lakers are 4 for 5 in the paint, and 0 for 7 on jump shots so far. 

If Austin Reaves makes an and-1 FT out of a time out, they'll trail by only 2 nonetheless, as they've been active defensively, holding GSW to 3 for 10 FG's (but 5 of 6 FT's)."

It will likely mean more Nunn/Reaves in the backcourt, and more Jones/Gabriel up front for Darvin Ham."
