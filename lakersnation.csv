1325,2023-03-13 03:03:27+00:00,LakersNation,Here come AD and DLo for what should be the remainder of the game.
1326,2023-03-13 03:00:58+00:00,LakersNation,So is Austin Reaves!

1337,2023-03-13 02:34:48+00:00,LakersNation,Thankfully Beasley gets a 3 to mercifully go and the Lakers are only down 68-66.
1338,2023-03-13 02:33:59+00:00,LakersNation,Troy misses another wide open 3. Need Rui in for him at this point.
1339,2023-03-13 02:32:23+00:00,LakersNation,Troy and Beasley being this cold is killing LA. Sheesh.
1340,2023-03-13 02:31:21+00:00,LakersNation,"Real rough game for Troy so far. Need him to get going, but at least AD gets the offensive board and free throws."

5675,2022-12-10 01:31:55+00:00,LakersNation,Austin Reaves for MVP.
5676,2022-12-10 01:30:03+00:00,LakersNation,No box out and AD has to let Embiid get the easy one.
5677,2022-12-10 01:29:15+00:00,LakersNation,Austin Reaves is a brave man. Stepped in to draw Embiid's second charge of the night
5678,2022-12-10 01:28:27+00:00,LakersNation,Embiid checks back in and immediately nails a 3. Lame.
5679,2022-12-10 01:27:58+00:00,LakersNation,LA has taken the lead.

5684,2022-12-10 01:16:52+00:00,LakersNation,Ham rolling the dice again and putting AD back in.
5685,2022-12-10 01:11:22+00:00,LakersNation,"After one, 76ers 31, #Lakers 20.

3 fouls on AD opened the flood gates for PHI."
5686,2022-12-10 01:10:34+00:00,LakersNation,Oof. Thomas Bryant got postered by Embiid there.

5692,2022-12-10 01:02:34+00:00,LakersNation,"No AD on the floor and PHI finds it easier to score at the rim.

LAL trail 17-12."
5693,2022-12-10 01:01:34+00:00,LakersNation,Embiid has 13 of the 76ers' 15 points.

87-68 Toronto during the break."
5750,2022-12-08 02:14:13+00:00,LakersNation,"Death, taxes, and free throws."
5751,2022-12-08 02:11:38+00:00,LakersNation,24th and 25th free throw attempts for the Lakers here. Has really helped keep them in the game.
5752,2022-12-08 02:07:30+00:00,LakersNation,Things are getting interesting...
5753,2022-12-08 02:06:39+00:00,LakersNation,Reaves has gotten so good at absorbing contact and finishing. Earns himself a nice 3-point opportunity
5754,2022-12-08 02:02:25+00:00,LakersNation,"We've got a timeout and LA is doing its best to hang around.

They are down 76-58."

5757,2022-12-08 02:00:00+00:00,LakersNation,Here comes Russ. Let's see if he can jumpstart another run like he did in the first quarter
5758,2022-12-08 01:58:54+00:00,LakersNation,"Well on the bright side, the Lakers have outscored the Raptors 3-2 so far. 

The down side is they're trailing 72-50, lol."

5763,2022-12-08 01:37:02+00:00,LakersNation,Let's stop fouling and put on a running clock. Who says no?
5764,2022-12-08 01:34:22+00:00,LakersNation,"Toronto, pls stop."
5765,2022-12-08 01:33:47+00:00,LakersNation,"Well, this has gotten kind of out of hand."

5767,2022-12-08 01:29:38+00:00,LakersNation,"Free throws galore this half, but Nick Nurse is challenging the foul call Russ just drew"
5768,2022-12-08 01:25:03+00:00,LakersNation,"Pretty sure FVV shot that from Quebec.

Lakers trailing the Raptors 52-41."
5769,2022-12-08 01:23:39+00:00,LakersNation,Would strongly prefer Russ eliminate the early shot clock 3 from his arsenal
5770,2022-12-08 01:22:44+00:00,LakersNation,Max Christie sighting!!!
5771,2022-12-08 01:22:04+00:00,LakersNation,I will always appreciate how hard TB runs the floor
5772,2022-12-08 01:18:04+00:00,LakersNation,"Plenty of free throws to go around this quarter, but it's helped the Lakers as they're only down 46-41."
5773,2022-12-08 01:16:10+00:00,LakersNation,"Dennis took a hard fall on that foul, but he looks to be alright. He's helped the Lakers hang around this half"
5774,2022-12-08 01:13:16+00:00,LakersNation,What I would give to have Damian Jones' athleticism...
5775,2022-12-08 01:12:51+00:00,LakersNation,"I don't like it when he passes up open shots, though."
5776,2022-12-08 01:11:49+00:00,LakersNation,Damian Jones with the volleyball spike. Sheesh
5777,2022-12-08 01:10:58+00:00,LakersNation,I miss LeBron and AD.
5778,2022-12-08 01:06:44+00:00,LakersNation,"After one, Raptors 39, #Lakers 31.

Defense was hard to come by for LA, but at least they found their groove offensively."
5779,2022-12-08 01:05:55+00:00,LakersNation,Russ blew an absolute laser of a pass from Troy Brown Jr. but at least he got the offensive board and score.
5780,2022-12-08 01:05:14+00:00,LakersNation,I like it when Kendrick Nunn shoots and scores.
5781,2022-12-08 01:00:14+00:00,LakersNation,"Lakers doing their best to hang around, but Raptors humming offensively. 

LA down 33-25 as we head into another break."
5782,2022-12-08 00:59:04+00:00,LakersNation,"Yeah, maybe let's not foul jumpshooters beyond the arc."
5783,2022-12-08 00:57:51+00:00,LakersNation,Good on the Lakers for continuing to attack the rim. Kendrick Nunn earns a trip to the line
5784,2022-12-08 00:55:33+00:00,LakersNation,"You should be fined if you ever foul Westbrook beyond the arc, lol"
5785,2022-12-08 00:51:35+00:00,LakersNation,"First timeout of the game and LA trails Toronto 21-15.

Not bad considering they were down 11-0 early."
5786,2022-12-08 00:51:02+00:00,LakersNation,"Lakers down 6, but they've certainly looked much better since Russ subbed in"
5787,2022-12-08 00:46:27+00:00,LakersNation,Well the offense has picked up at least. Need more stops now
5788,2022-12-08 00:45:22+00:00,LakersNation,Reaves with his own 3 to finally get LA on the board
5789,2022-12-08 00:44:59+00:00,LakersNation,Russ with the early sub as the Lakers are already trailing 11-0.
